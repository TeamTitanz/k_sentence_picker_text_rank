those concrete findings matter to these cases which,after all,turn on whether epa reasonably took costs into account in regulating plants emissions of hazardous air pollutants.the majority insists that it may ignore epa analysis because epa did not rely on it when issuing the initial appropriate and necessary finding.ante,at quoting solicitor general see also sec chenery.at one level,that description is true indeed,a simple function of chronology the finding preceded the analysis by years and so could not have taken its conclusions into account.but more fundamentally,the majority account is off,because epa knew when it made that finding that it would consider costs at every subsequent stage,culminating in a formal study.and epa knew that,absent unusual circumstances,the rule would need to pass that review in order to issue.see exec.order,fed.reg.each agency shall adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs the reasonableness of the agency decision to consider only the harms of emissions at the threshold stage must be evaluated in that broader context.and in thinking about that issue,it is well to remember the outcome here a rule whose benefits exceed its costs by three to nine times.in making its appropriate and necessary finding,epa had committed to assessing and mitigating costs throughout the rest of its rulemaking if nothing else,the findings of the agency analysis making clear that the final emissions standards were show that epa did just that.
that is a peculiarly blinkered way for a court to assess the lawfulness of an agency rulemaking.i agree with the majority let there be no doubt about this that epa power plant regulation would be unreasonable if t he agency gave cost no thought at all.ante,at emphasis in original.but that is just not what happened here.over more than a decade,epa took costs into account at multiple stages and through multiple means as it set emissions limits for power plants.and when making its initial appropriate and necessary finding,epa knew it would do exactly that knew it would thoroughly consider the of emissions standards later on.that context matters.the agency acted well within its authority in declining to consider costs at the opening bell of the regulatory process given that it would do so in every round thereafter and given that the emissions limits finally issued would depend crucially on those accountings.indeed,epa could not have measured costs at the process initial stage with any accuracy.and the regulatory path epa chose parallels the one it has trod in setting emissions limits,at congress explicit direction,for every other source of hazardous air pollutants over two decades.the majority decision that epa can not take the same approach here its micromanagement of epa rulemaking,based on little more than the word appropriate runs counter to congress allocation of authority between the agency and the courts.because epa reasonably found that it was appropriate to decline to analyze costs at a single stage of a regulatory proceeding otherwise imbued with cost concerns,i respectfully dissent.
the clean air act directs the environmental protection agency to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from certain stationary sources such as refineries and factories.the agency may regulate power plants under this program only if it concludes that regulation is appropriate and necessary after studying hazards to public health posed by emissions.n a.here,epa found regulation appropriate because the plants emissions pose risks to public health and the environment and because controls capable of reducing these emissions were available.it found regulation necessary because the imposition of other clean air act requirements did not eliminate those risks.the agency refused to consider cost when making its decision.it estimated,however,that the cost of its regulations to power plants would be billion a year,but the quantifiable benefits from the resulting reduction in emissions would be to million a year.petitioners including states sought review of epa rule in the circuit,which upheld the agency refusal to consider costs in its decision to regulate.
at the same time,congress established a unique procedure to determine the applicability of the program to power plants.the act refers to these plants as electric utility steam generating units,but we will simply call them power plants.quite apart from the program,the clean air act amendments of subjected power plants to various regulatory requirements.the parties agree that these requirements were expected to have the collateral effect of reducing power plants emissions of hazardous air pollutants,although the extent of the reduction was unclear.congress directed the agency to perform a study of the hazards to public health reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of emissions by power plants of hazardous air pollutants after imposition of the requirements of this chapter.n a.if the agency finds regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the study,it shall regulate power plants under.ibid.epa has interpreted the act to mean that power plants become subject to regulation on the same terms as ordinary major and area sources,see fed.reg,and we assume without deciding that it was correct to do so.
epa disregard of cost rested on its interpretation of n a,which,to repeat,directs the agency to regulate power plants if it finds such regulation is appropriate and necessary.the agency accepts that it could have interpreted this provision to mean that cost is relevant to the decision to add power plants to the program.tr.of oral arg.but it chose to read the statute to mean that cost makes no difference to the initial decision to regulate.see fed.reg.we further interpret the term appropriate to not allow for the consideration of costs fed.reg.cost does not have to be read into the definition of appropriate.
the clean air act amendments of,as the majority describes,obligate epa to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from stationary sources discharging those substances in large quantities.see ante,at.for most industries,the statute prescribes the same regulatory process.at the initial stage,epa must decide whether to regulate a source,based solely on the quantity of pollutants it emits and their health and environmental effects.see a,a,c,c ante,at.costs enter the equation after that,affecting the emissions limits that the eventual regulation will require.under the statute,epa must divide sources into categories and subcategories and then set floor standards that reflect the average emissions level already achieved by the of sources within each group.see d ante,at.every floor has cost concerns built right into it because the top sources,as successful actors in a market economy,have had to consider costs in choosing their own emissions levels.moreover,in establishing categories and subcategories at this first stage,epa can significantly raise or lower the costs of regulation for each source,because different classification schemes will alter the group and so the emissions level that the source has to match once the floor is set,epa has to decide whether to impose any stricter standards,taking into consideration,among other things,the cost of achieving such emissions reduction.d see ante,at.finally,by virtue of a longstanding executive order applying to significant rules issued under the clean air act as well as other statutes,the agency must systematically assess the regulation costs and benefits.see exec.order,fed.reg,applying to all rules with an annual economic effect of at least million.
the dissent does not embrace epa claim that congress made costs altogether irrelevant to the decision to regulate power plants.instead,it maintains that epa need not explicitly analyze costs before deeming regulation appropriate,because other features of the regulatory program will on their own ensure the of regulation.post,at opinion of kagan.this line of reasoning contradicts the foundational principle of administrative law that a court may uphold agency action only on the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.sec chenery.when it deemed regulation of power plants appropriate,epa said that cost was irrelevant to that determination not that analysis would be deferred until later.much less did it say what the dissent now concludes that the consideration of cost at subsequent stages will ensure that the costs are not disproportionate to the benefits.what it said is that cost is irrelevant to the decision to regulate.
to start,that decision brought epa regulation of power plants into sync with its regulation of every other significant source of hazardous pollutants under the clean air act.for all those types of sources totaling over,the act instructs epa to make the threshold decision to regulate based solely on the quantity and effects of pollutants discharged costs enter the picture afterward,when the agency takes up the task of actually establishing emissions limits.see supra,at.industry after industry,year after year,epa has followed that approach to,just as congress contemplated.see,fed.reg.dry cleaning facilities fed.reg.gasoline distributors fed.reg.aerospace manufacturers.and apparently with considerable success.at any rate,neither those challenging this rule nor the court remotely suggests that these regulatory regimes have done significantly more harm than good.ante,at.so when making its appropriate and necessary finding for power plants,epa had good reason to continue in the same vein.see,entergy,at opinion of breyer,noting that the reasonableness of an agency approach to considering costs rests in part on whether that tack has met with apparent success in the past and that is exactly how epa explained its choice.stating that it would consider the costs of controls when developing a regulation,the agency noted that such an approach has helped build flexibility in meeting environmental objectives in the past,thereby preventing the imposition of disproportionate costs.fed.reg.indeed,as epa further commented in issuing its rule,it would seem inequitable to impose a regulatory regime on every industry in america and then to exempt one category after finding it represented a significant part of the air toxics problem.fed.reg.quoting cong.rec.statement of durenberger.
epa persists that congress treated power plants differently from other sources because of uncertainty about whether regulation of power plants would still be needed after the application of the rest of the act requirements.that is undoubtedly one of the reasons congress treated power plants differently hence n a requirement to study hazards posed by power plants emissions after imposition of the requirements of the rest of the act.but if uncertainty about the need for regulation were the only reason to treat power plants differently,congress would have required the agency to decide only whether regulation remains necessary,not whether regulation is appropriate and necessary.in any event,epa stated when it adopted the rule that congress did not limit the appropriate and necessary inquiry to the study mentioned in n a.fed.reg.the agency instead decided that the finding should be understood in light of all three studies required by n,and as we have discussed,one of those three studies reflects concern about cost.
statutory context reinforces the relevance of cost.the procedures governing power plants that we consider today appear in n,which bears the caption electric utility steam generating units.in subparagraph a,the part of the law that has occupied our attention so far,congress required epa to study the hazards to public health posed by power plants and to determine whether regulation is appropriate and necessary.but in subparagraphs b and c,congress called for two additional studies.one of them,a study into mercury emissions from power plants and other sources,must consider the health and environmental effects of such emissions,technologies which are available to control such emissions,and the costs of such technologies.n b emphasis added.this directive to epa to study cost is a further indication of the relevance of cost to the decision to regulate.
congress modified that regulatory scheme for power plants.it did so because the amendments established a separate program to control power plant emissions contributing to acid rain,and many thought that just by complying with those requirements,plants might reduce their emissions of hazardous air pollutants to acceptable levels.see ante,at.that prospect counseled a wait and see approach,under which epa would give the act acid rain provisions a chance to achieve that side benefit before imposing any further regulation.accordingly,congress instructed epa to perform a study of the hazards to public health reasonably anticipated to result from power plants emissions after the amendments had taken effect.n a.and congress provided that epa shall regulate those emissions only if the agency finds such regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the public health study.ibid.upon making such a finding,however,epa is to regulate power plants as it does every other stationary source first,by categorizing plants and setting floor standards for the different groups then by deciding whether to regulate beyond the floors and finally,by conducting the analysis required by executive order.
that is the question presented here,and it nearly answers itself.setting emissions levels for hazardous air pollutants is necessarily a lengthy and complicated process,demanding analysis of many considerations over many years.costs are a key factor in that process as i have said,sensible regulation requires careful scrutiny of the burdens that potential rules impose.see supra,at.but in ordering its regulatory process,epa knew it would have the opportunity to consider costs in one after another of that rulemaking stages in setting the level of floor standards,in providing a range of options for plants to meet them,in deciding whether or where to require limits beyond the floor,and in finally completing a formal analysis.see fed.reg.supra,at.given that context,epa reasonably decided that it was appropriate once again,the only statutory requirement relevant here to trigger the regulatory process based on the twin findings that the emissions in question cause profound health and environmental harms and that available pollution control technologies can reduce those emissions.by making that decision,epa did no more than commit itself to developing a realistic and regulation a rule that would take account of every relevant factor,costs and benefits alike.and indeed,particular features of the statutory scheme here indicate that epa policy choice was not just a minimally reasonable option but an eminently reasonable one.
our reasoning so far establishes that it was unreasonable for epa to read n a to mean that cost is irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate power plants.the agency must consider cost including,most importantly,cost of compliance before deciding whether regulation is appropriate and necessary.we need not and do not hold that the law unambiguously required the agency,when making this preliminary estimate,to conduct a formal analysis in which each advantage and disadvantage is assigned a monetary value.it will be up to the agency to decide as always,within the limits of reasonable interpretation how to account for cost.
that proposition,however,does not decide the issue before us because the appropriate and necessary finding was only the beginning.at that stage,epa knew that a lengthy rulemaking process lay ahead of it the determination of emissions limits was still years away.and the agency,in making its finding,explicitly noted that consideration of costs would follow as a part of developing a regulation that would impose those limits,the effectiveness and costs of controls will be examined.fed.reg.likewise,epa explained that,in the course of writing its regulation,it would explore regulatory approaches allowing for solutions.at.that means the agency,when making its appropriate and necessary finding,did not decline to consider costs as part of the regulatory process.rather,it declined to consider costs at a single stage of that process,knowing that they would come in later on.
epa argues that the clean air act makes cost irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate sources other than power plants.the agency claims that it is reasonable to interpret n a in a way that harmonizes the program treatment of power plants with its treatment of other sources.this line of reasoning overlooks the whole point of having a separate provision about power plants treating power plants differently from other stationary sources.congress crafted narrow standards for epa to apply when deciding whether to regulate other sources in general,these standards concern the volume of pollution emitted by the source,c,and the threat posed by the source to human health or the environment,c.but congress wrote the provision before us more expansively,directing the agency to regulate power plants if appropriate and necessary.that congressional election settles this case.the agency preference for symmetry can not trump an asymmetrical statute.csx,alabama of revenue.
the clean air act treats power plants differently from other sources for purposes of the program.elsewhere in,congress established cabined criteria for epa to apply when deciding whether to include sources in the program.it required the agency to regulate sources whose emissions exceed specified numerical thresholds major sources.it also required the agency to regulate sources whose emissions fall short of these thresholds area sources if they presen t a threat of adverse effects to human health or the environment warranting regulation.c.in stark contrast,congress instructed epa to add power plants to the program if but only if the agency finds regulation appropriate and necessary.n a.one does not need to open up a dictionary in order to realize the capaciousness of this phrase.in particular,appropriate is the classic broad and term that naturally and traditionally includes consideration of all the relevant factors.at opinion of kavanaugh.although this term leaves agencies with flexibility,an agency may not entirely fai l to consider an important aspect of the problem when deciding whether regulation is appropriate.state farm,supra,at.
turning to the mechanics of the program,epa argues that it need not consider cost when first deciding whether to regulate power plants because it can consider cost later when deciding how much to regulate them.the question before us,however,is the meaning of the appropriate and necessary standard that governs the initial decision to regulate.and as we have discussed,context establishes that this expansive standard encompasses cost.cost may become relevant again at a later stage of the regulatory process,but that possibility does not establish its irrelevance at this stage.in addition,once the agency decides to regulate power plants,it must promulgate certain minimum or floor standards no matter the cost here,nearly billion a year the agency may consider cost only when imposing regulations beyond these minimum standards.by epa logic,someone could decide whether it is appropriate to buy a ferrari without thinking about cost,because he plans to think about cost later when deciding whether to upgrade the sound system.
the environmental protection agency placed emissions limits on coal and oil power plants following a lengthy regulatory process during which the agency carefully considered costs.at the outset,epa determined that regulating plants emissions of hazardous air pollutants is appropriate and necessary given the harm they cause,and explained that it would take costs into account in developing suitable emissions standards.next,epa divided power plants into groups based on technological and other characteristics bearing significantly on their cost structures.it required plants in each group to match the emissions levels already achieved by the members of the same group benchmarks necessarily reflecting those plants own cost analyses.epa then adopted a host of measures designed to make compliance with its proposed emissions limits less costly for plants that needed to catch up with their cleaner peers.and with only one narrow exception,epa decided not to impose any more stringent standards beyond what some plants had already achieved on their own because it found that doing so would not be.after all that,epa conducted a formal study which found that the quantifiable benefits of its regulation would exceed the costs up to nine times over by as much as billion each year.those benefits include as many as fewer premature deaths annually,along with a far greater number of avoided illnesses.
epa completed the study required by n a in,fed.reg,and concluded that regulation of coal and power plants was appropriate and necessary in,at.in,it reaffirmed the finding,divided power plants into subcategories,and promulgated floor standards.the agency found regulation appropriate because power plants emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants posed risks to human health and the environment and controls were available to reduce these emissions.fed.reg.it found regulation necessary because the imposition of the act other requirements did not eliminate these risks.ibid.epa concluded that costs should not be considered when deciding whether power plants should be regulated under,at.
the majority attempt to answer this point founders on even its own statement of facts.the majority objects that the whole point of having a separate provision about power plants is to treat power plants differently from other stationary sources.ante,at emphasis in original.but turn back about pages,and read what the majority says about why congress treated power plants differently because,as all parties agree,separate regulatory requirements involving acid rain were expected to have the collateral effect of reducing power plants emissions of hazardous air pollutants,although the extent of the reduction was unclear.ante,at see supra,at.for that reason alone the majority does not offer any other,congress diverted epa from its usual regulatory path,instructing the agency,as a preliminary matter,to complete and consider a study about the residual harms to public health arising from those emissions.see ante,at supra,at.but once epa found in its study that the acid rain provisions would not significantly affect power plants emissions of hazardous pollutants,any rationale for treating power plants differently from other sources discharging the same substances went up in smoke.see fed.reg.at that point,the agency would have had far more explaining to do if,rather than following a model,it had devised a new scheme of regulation for power plants only.
